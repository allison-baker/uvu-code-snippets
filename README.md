# Welcome to UVU Code Snippets!

In December 2023, UVU began their website redesign project. As the developer on the Smith College of Engineering & Technology Marketing Team, I began keeping track of custom components and components used on other UVU sites that were modified for our pages. There is currently (as of Oct 2024) no web standard for UVU. There is an elements library, but colleges and departments are free to alter the components or create their own custom code. This was created in an attempt to standardize the webpages in the College of Engineering & Technology, of which there are currently over 900. At the end of this project, we will have updated around 170 pages.

## In this Repository

1. HTML for all custom components.
2. Reference HTML for some UVU components.
3. CSS for all custom components.
4. CSS that modifies existing UVU components to match CET designs and/or make the component more responsive.
6. The common CSS used on all CET pages.
7. Instructions for creating student work directories using the CET video template or blog template.
8. Some JS snippets (for sliders and countup).

The pages are all documented with any tips a UVU developer would need to recreate these components on their own pages. The directories with examples for student work and the blog have readme files with in depth instructions. There are a few images used in these instruction files, and for some components that implement APFY shapes. Placeholder images in components are created through [Placehold](https://www.placehold.co/).

## Developing for UVU
