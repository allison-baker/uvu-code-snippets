# Welcome to UVU Code Snippets!

In December 2023, UVU began their website redesign project. As the developer on the Smith College of Engineering & Technology Marketing Team, I began keeping track of custom components and components used on other UVU sites that were modified for our pages.

## In this Repository

1. HTML for all custom components
2. Reference HTML for some UVU components
3. CSS for all custom components
4. CSS that can be used to modify existing UVU components
5. A copy of the common.js file used across all UVU websites
6. A sample page of all the CSS needed to create a basic program page following the CET template
7. The JavaScript needed to create a slider using slider.js

The pages are all documented with any tips a UVU developer would need to recreate these components on their own pages. If you have any questions, you can reach me (Al Baker, CET MarCom Student Developer) at [al.baker@uvu.edu)](mailto:al.baker@uvu.edu).

## Developing for UVU

UVU uses Omni CMS and Bootstrap to develop their websites.
